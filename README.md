Simulations of different pendulum models, including linear single, nonlinear single, and double-pendulum objects. Uses forward-Euler to calculate new positions.

Pendulums have variable lengths, masses, colours and positions. The pendulums sit inside a scene with zoom and position attributes so the animation can be rescaled to fit whatever viewport you need.
